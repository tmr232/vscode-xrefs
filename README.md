# Xrefs

A nicer xrefs display for VSCode.

Inspired by [References++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jrieken.references-plusplus).

## Roadmap

These are ideas I want to explore, no promises!

- Differentiate reads from writes using tree-sitter, reflect that in the results
- Consider adding a tree-view as a result option
- Allow commenting on results or mark them as "ignored"
